<summary>Introduction to RISC-V</summary>

**RISC-V** (pronounced "risk-five") is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that has gained significant attention and popularity in recent years. It is designed to be simple, modular, and customizable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from embedded systems to supercomputers. In this introduction to RISC-V architecture, we'll cover its key concepts and characteristics:

**Open Source Philosophy:**
RISC-V is an open-source ISA, which means its specifications are freely available to the public. This openness encourages collaboration and innovation, allowing anyone to design, implement, and customize RISC-V processors without licensing fees.

**RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer):**
RISC-V follows the RISC design philosophy, which emphasizes a small and simple set of instructions. This simplicity makes it easier to design efficient and high-performance processors.

**Modular and Extensible:**
RISC-V is designed with modularity in mind. It provides a base set of instructions, known as the RV32I (for 32-bit) and RV64I (for 64-bit) instruction sets, which serve as a foundation. Beyond these base sets, custom instruction extensions can be added to meet the specific needs of different applications. This extensibility enables the architecture to be tailored for various domains, from IoT devices to data centers.

**Multiple Standard Extensions:**
RISC-V offers several standard extensions, including integer (I), multiplication and division (M), atomic (A), single-precision floating-point (F), double-precision floating-point (D), vector (V), and more. These extensions add functionality to the base architecture as needed.

**Support for Different Bit Widths:**
RISC-V supports various bit widths, such as 32, 64, and 128 bits, making it adaptable to a wide range of computing environments.

**Load-Store Architecture:**
RISC-V follows a load-store architecture, where memory operations are performed using load and store instructions. This design simplifies the instruction set and helps maintain a consistent pipeline for better performance.

**User and Privileged Modes:**
RISC-V has multiple privilege levels, including user mode, supervisor mode, and machine mode. This privilege hierarchy enables secure execution of software and is useful for implementing operating systems.

**Instruction Encoding:**
RISC-V instructions are typically encoded as fixed-length 32-bit or 64-bit words, depending on the chosen bit width. The simplicity of instruction encoding contributes to the architecture's ease of implementation.

**Wide Industry Support:**
RISC-V has gained support from a broad range of industry players, including academia, startups, and established companies. This support has led to the development of RISC-V-based hardware and software ecosystems.
**Applications:**
RISC-V is used in various applications, from low-power IoT devices and microcontrollers to high-performance servers and supercomputers. Its versatility and openness make it a compelling choice for a wide array of computing tasks.

EDA Tools: For digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design, various EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools are essential to complete the design process efficiently like Qflow, OpenROAD, OpenLANE, etc.

RTL: RTL IP blocks are reusable building blocks for digital designs. They encapsulate specific functions or features and are designed to be easily integrated into larger designs, reducing the need for designing these functions from scratch.

PDK: Process Design Kit is the collection of files used to model a fabrication process for the EDA Tools used to design an IC like Google+Skywater FOSS 130nm Production PDK.

**Simplified RTL to GDS Flow**
The RTL to GDS (Register-Transfer Level to Graphic Design System) flow is a series of steps and tools used in the semiconductor industry to transform a digital circuit's high-level description (RTL) into a physical layout that can be fabricated as an integrated circuit (IC) using a specific semiconductor process. Here's an overview of the typical RTL to GDS flow:

Design Specification:
Start with a clear specification of the desired functionality and performance requirements of the digital circuit.

RTL Design:
Create a Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL. The RTL code describes the behavior and functionality of the digital circuit.

Simulation and Verification:
Simulate the RTL code using tools like ModelSim or VCS to verify that the design functions correctly. This involves creating testbenches and running simulations to ensure that the RTL code meets the design requirements.

Synthesis:
Use a synthesis tool (e.g., Synopsys Design Compiler, Cadence Genus) to convert the RTL code into a gate-level netlist. The synthesis process optimizes the design for area, power, and speed while targeting a specific semiconductor technology library.

Gate-Level Simulation:
Perform gate-level simulations to verify that the synthesized netlist behaves as expected and is functionally correct.

Floor Planning:
Define the physical layout of the chip, including the placement of logic blocks, standard cells, and I/O pads. This step determines the overall chip size and the placement of key components.

Place-and-Route (P&R):
Use a place-and-route tool (e.g., Cadence Innovus, Synopsys ICC) to map the gate-level netlist onto the physical chip's layout. This step involves placing the cells on the chip and routing the interconnections between them.

Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):
Create a clock distribution network to ensure that clock signals reach all parts of the chip with minimal skew and jitter.

Power Planning:
Plan the power distribution network to ensure that all components receive the required power supply voltages and currents.

Physical Verification:
Perform physical verification checks, including Design Rule Checking (DRC), Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) checks, and Parasitic Extraction (PEX) to ensure that the layout adheres to the semiconductor process rules and matches the expected functionality.

Timing Analysis:
Perform static timing analysis (STA) to verify that the design meets its timing requirements, such as setup and hold times, clock-to-q delays, and maximum operating frequency.

Mask Generation:
Generate the mask data required for semiconductor manufacturing based on the final layout. This data includes information on the placement of transistor gates and interconnects.

Foundry Services:
Send the mask data to a semiconductor foundry for fabrication. The foundry manufactures the physical ICs using the specified semiconductor process.

Testing and Debugging:
After fabrication, the ICs undergo testing to ensure they function correctly. Any defects or issues discovered during testing may require further debugging and iteration.

Packaging and Assembly:
The fabricated ICs are packaged, which involves placing them in protective enclosures and connecting them to external pins or balls for electrical connections.

Final Testing:
Perform final testing on the packaged ICs to verify their functionality and performance.

Release and Deployment:
The final ICs are ready for deployment in various electronic devices and systems.

<h1>Day 2 : Floorplanning and Introduction to Library Cells</h1>
<details>
  <summary><b>Chip Floorplanning considerations</b></summary>
  <h3>Floorplanning</h3>
  <p>Floorplanning is a crucial early-stage step in the physical design process, where the initial layout of the chip is defined. It involves making high-level decisions about how various components will be arranged on the silicon substrate.</p>
  <h3>Core Area Definition:</h3>
  <p>Determine the overall dimensions of the chip and define the core area where the primary functional blocks and standard cells will be placed. This core area is surrounded by peripheral regions that may contain I/O pads and other necessary structures.</p>
  <h4>Utilization Factor</h4>
  <p>The Utilization Factor is calculated as the area occupied by the netlist divided by the total core area. A Utilization Factor of 1 indicates full utilization with no extra space, but in practice, it's typically around 0.5-0.6.</p>
  
```
  Utilization factor = Area occupied by Netlist/Total core Area
```

  <h4>Aspect ratio</h4>
  <p>The Aspect Ratio is the ratio of the chip's height to its width. A value of 1 signifies a square chip, while other values represent a rectangular shape.</p>
  
```
Aspect ratio = Chip Height/Chip Width
```  
  
  

  <h3>Preplaced cells</h3>
  <p>Pre-placed cells are fixed-position Intellectual Properties (IPs) with significant combinational logic. They're positioned before automated placement and routing in integrated circuit design, hence the term "pre-placed."</p>
  <p>Preplaced cells are generally placed at the location from where it is nearest to all the other circuit blocks accessing it. Once placed they are not modified in terms of location thereafter.</p>

  <h3>Decoupling Capacitor</h3>
  <p>
    Pre-placed cells are often accompanied by decoupling capacitors (decaps) in integrated circuit (IC) design. Long wire lengths introduce resistive and capacitive effects that can result in substantial power supply voltage drops before reaching the logic circuits. This can push signal values into undefined regions, beyond the noise margin. Decaps are substantial capacitors charged to the power supply voltage and strategically positioned near the logic circuits. Their primary purpose is to decouple the circuit from the power supply, ensuring a stable voltage and supplying instantaneous current when needed. Decaps also mitigate crosstalk and facilitate efficient local communication.
  </p>
<h3>The problem of unstable ground</h3>
<div align ="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/NiteshIIITB/Physical_Design/assets/140998787/fc5b5efb-0477-460e-8c4b-cc877733fc59">

  <br>
  
</div> 
<p>Due to this it may happen that some of logic values may break Noise Margin producing errorneous results.</p>
<h3>Power Planning(Solution)</h3>
<p>While each block on the chip cannot have individual decoupling capacitors (decaps) like pre-placed macros, effective power planning ensures that each block is equipped with its dedicated VDD and VSS pads. These pads are strategically connected to the horizontal and vertical power and ground (GND) lines, forming a comprehensive power mesh.</p>

<h3>Pin Placement</h3>
<p>The netlist specifies the interconnections between logic gates within the design. The region between the core and the chip's periphery is designated for the placement of I/O pins. Information regarding connectivity, often described in VHDL or Verilog, is leveraged to determine the precise locations of I/O pads for various pins. Subsequently, logical placement distinguishes the area allocated for pre-placed macros from the dedicated pin area.</p>

  <summary><b>Floorplan in Openlane</b></summary>
  To perform the floorplanning process for the "picorv32a" design in OpenLANE and visualize the results in Magic, follow these steps, considering the importance files and environment variables:<br>

Important Files (in increasing priority order):<br>

<ul>
 <li>floorplan.tcl - System default environment variables.</li>
<li>config.tcl</li>
<li>sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl</li>
</ul>
Floorplan Environment Variables or Switches:
<ul>
<li><b>FP_CORE_UTIL:</b> Specifies floorplan core utilization.</li>
<li><b>FP_ASPECT_RATIO:</b> Sets the floorplan aspect ratio.</li>
<li><b>FP_CORE_MARGIN:</b> Defines the core-to-die margin area.</li>
<li><b>FP_IO_MODE:</b> Determines pin configurations (1 for equidistant, 0 for non-equidistant).</li>
<li><b>FP_CORE_VMETAL:</b> Sets the vertical metal layer.</li>
<li><b>FP_CORE_HMETAL:</b> Sets the horizontal metal layer.<br> 
Typically, these values are one greater than what's specified in the files.</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Command used</h4>

</div>

<h4>Post-Floorplan Run and Viewing the Floorplan in Magic:</h4>
<ul>
<li>After running the floorplan step in OpenLANE, a .def file representing the floorplan will be generated within the results/floorplan directory. This file encapsulates the layout and organization of the integrated circuit components.</li>
<li>To visualize the floorplan layout using the Magic VLSI layout tool, follow these steps:<br>

Open a terminal or command prompt.<br>

Navigate to the ```results/floorplan``` directory within your OpenLANE workspace.<br>
Once you're in the ```results/floorplan``` directory, invoke Magic to view the floorplan by running the following command:<br>

```
magic -T /home/OpenLane/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.min.lef def read picorv32.def &
```

</li>  
<div align="center">

</div>  
</ul>  
In Magic layout design software:<br>
To zoom into a specific area of the layout, you can use the following steps:<br>
<ul>
<li>Select an area by clicking the left mouse button and dragging to create a selection box.</li>
<li>Then, hold the right mouse button and press the 'z' key. This action should zoom in on the selected area.</li>
</ul>
 <br> 
To identify various components within the layout, you can use the `what` command within the tkcon window. After making a selection (e.g., clicking on a component), enter the `what` command to get information about the selected component.
<br>
When you zoom in, you can also get a closer view of the decaps (decapacitors) present in the picorv32a chip or any other components.<br>

<br>
The standard cell can typically be found at the bottom left corner of the layout.<br>

  <summary><b>Placement</b></summary>
  Placement
The placement step in the OpenLANE ASIC flow involves positioning the synthesized netlist onto the floorplan. This process is performed in two stages:

<b>Global Placement:</b> In this stage, an optimal position for all cells is determined. The positions may not initially be legal, and cells may overlap. Optimization is carried out with the goal of reducing half-parameter wire length.

<b>Detailed Placement:</b> Following global placement, the positions of cells are adjusted to make them legal within the design. Legalizing cells is crucial from a timing perspective, ensuring that the chip meets its performance requirements.

Running the placement step in OpenLANE and visualizing the placement results in Magic can be accomplished with the following command:


```
run_placement
```


<div align="center">
<img width="1080" alt="2-2" src="https://github.com/VaibhavTiwari-IIITB/Physical_Design_using_OpenLANE/assets/140998525/1528c8e9-9166-4a8f-a684-2fe24bfe6512">
  
</div>

After running the placement step, you can use Magic to inspect and analyze the placement of cells, ensuring that they are positioned optimally and legally within the floorplan.
